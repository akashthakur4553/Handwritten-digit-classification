# Handwritten-digit-classification
The project is a webapp that classifies handwritten digits using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on the CIFAR-10 dataset involves building a machine learning model that can recognize and classify images of handwritten digits. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset for image classification that contains 60,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, with 10 classes of objects (0-9).

To classify the handwritten digits, you would first need to preprocess the images by converting them to a suitable format and normalizing the pixel values. You would then split the dataset into a training set and a test set, and use the training set to train the ANN.

The ANN would be composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process the input data and generate an output. The output of the ANN would be a prediction of the class of the input image (i.e., a digit from 0 to 9).

During the training process, the ANN would be fed the training data and would adjust the weights and biases of its connections based on the error between its predicted output and the true labels of the training data. This process, known as backpropagation, would continue until the error is minimized and the ANN is able to accurately classify the training data.

Once the training is complete, you would use the test set to evaluate the performance of the ANN by comparing its predictions to the true labels of the test data. You would then use various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, to quantify the effectiveness of the ANN at classifying the handwritten digits.

Overall, the goal of this project is to build an ANN that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
